# lf2app
This is the support page for the "Looking Forward To" iOS and WatchOS application.  You can file any bug reports or feature requests via the [Issues](https://github.com/derammo/lf2app/issues) tab.

# Instructions
In your favorite calendar application, just add the text tag "#lf2" (without quotes) to the title, location, or notes field of a calendar event.   If you want to specify an icon to show, include the name of the icon after the tag, like so: #lf2(dragon)

Alternatively, you can configure additional tags in the Settings tab of the application.  For example, you can configure all events that mention "Party" to be shown with a "cocktail" icon.   The icon library is built into the application.  It will grow in future versions and requests for additional icons are welcome.

# Advanced Instructions
If your tag refers to an icon that looks like a DNS domain (for example, "irs.gov" or "apple.com"), then you can use the "Icons" tab to download that web site's favorites icon.  The app will automatically convert this to a Watch Complication icon and attempt to make it pretty.

# Licensing
Note that any contributions to this repository become public under the Eclipse Public license.  Particularly, if you want to provide a pull request for an icon you would like to see in the app, then this icon must be distributable under that license.  For example, you can draw it yourself and then contribute it under that license.

The "Looking Forward To" application itself is distributed under a commercial license.  

Some of the icons in the icon library are provided by [www.icons8.com](http://www.icons8.com).  You can always request inclusion of more icons from that site, since they are already licensed.  Do not copy the icons, just reference them in an [Issue](https://github.com/derammo/lf2app/issues).
